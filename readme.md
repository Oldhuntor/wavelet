# Models

1. Time Series classification and Anomaly detection using wavelet transformation as feature extractor.

2. Continuous Wavelet Transform using pywt

3. Discrete Wavelet Transform with high-low pass filters

4. Morlet Wavelet with Phase spectrum and Frequencies magnitude 

5. Use OMF(Quadrature Mirror Filter) as a constraint for Learnable wavelet
