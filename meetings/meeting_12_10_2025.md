1. need to find a way for the make the model choose the kernel itselfs
2. Read the paper of TabPFN (in Context learning)
3. maybe be try wavelet + Deans
4. Learnable wavelet with autoencoder can lead to problems 
5. Need to try out MRA without dual features √
6. CNN should be faster since it has lesser parameters √
7. Use different filters to reconstruct the signal, if the signal is reconstructed well then this filter is a good filter. √
8. But have to remember that some transformation contain redundant information which means it can always reconstruct well. √
9. need to try out all combination of the model to know which component suits the most
10. with chosen filters the model is explainable


how can I make deans model produce point anomaly score?
