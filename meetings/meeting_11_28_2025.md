# Meetings summary

1. Is doing Fourier transformation the same as averaging out the wavelet results?

2. Use three different filters to create a multi channels graph, and then use a 2d CNN to extract features.

3. The overfitting problem has to be addressed, probably too many parameters in the linear layer at the end.

4. Averaging out the time step will reduce the number of parameters.
