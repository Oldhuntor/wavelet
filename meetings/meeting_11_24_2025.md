# The condition for a proper mother wavelet 

## zero mean

![img_1.png](image/img_1.png)

## squared-integrable

## no zero frequency amplitude

## Orthogonal

# Learnable kernel 

## Prior knowledge is important 

## use a set of kernels and vote

# The CNN itself is a learnable filter?

# Can we say that wavelet is a CNN with some mathematical restrictions

# a general learnable basis?

# The input for the dean model



# Meeting summary

Resnet, u-net (multi scale analysis)

skip connection

thinking about what's the proper scale method

the website for finding time series classification data (https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/dataset.php)

firstly make the algorithm runable 

# PS

ask my parents about the flight on Feb. 18th, will the shopping mall close
and will there be restrictions
